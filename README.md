# CTR Prediction Model
### Introduction
This project predicts the Ads Click-Through Rate (CTR). In online advertising, CTR is a very important metric for evaluating ad performance. As a result, click prediction systems are essential and widely used for sponsored search and real-time bidding.<br>

### Requirements 
(Please refer to **ctr-final.ipynb** file only)<br>
The code is strictly based on Data set from https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/data. Using Other data sets may result in error.<br>
Atleast 12 GB RAM<br>
Following Python Libraries installed:<br>
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib.pyplot
* Sklearn (Scikit-learn)
* XGBoost
* Random

### Steps for running
1. Comment out first cell if you are not using kaggle notebooks
(For running as it is).
2. If you don't have access to any high memory system either locally or online, you can reduce the number of samples by reducing the "Sample_size".
3. Replace the path name "../input/avazu-ctr-prediction/train.gz" with the your file path.
4. Rest of the code can be used as it is.
